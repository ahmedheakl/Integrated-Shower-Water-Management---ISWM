# ISWM
A project aimed to decrease the amount of waste of water via controlling the quantity used before the water gets warm before showering. Also, the wastewater of the shower is divided so that some of it goes to the combination, and the other part is recycled for showering again. The project uses Arduino as its main micro-controller with the help of some sensors and actuators.
